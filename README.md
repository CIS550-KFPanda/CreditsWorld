Artists and repertoire (known as A&R) is the division of a record label or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of recording artists and songwriters1. To create meaningful music sessions, A&R managers need to pair up artists, songwriters, and producers. This matchmaking is often done by leveraging personal connections and is kept personally. 

The goal of this project is to create a website that A&R managers could visit to learn about what type of connections worked in the past, to create more meaningful connections in the future.
